* Read the CSV file named "budget_data.csv" 
* Calculated the total number of months included in the dataset
* Found out the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Found the average changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Found the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* Found the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
* Printed the analysis in a txt file

To extract the above analysis, I followed below steps. 

* Read the CSV file named "election_data.csv" 
* Calculated the total number of votes cast
* Calculated the total number of votes each candidate won
* Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won
* Determined the winner of the election based on the popular vote
* Printed the analysis in a txt file 



Note: My information source were two datasets. The first dataset was a CSV file named as budget_data containing, date, profit and loss the x company made during 2023. The other CSV file was named election_data. In this dataset I had the ballot ids, country and candidate names.
